#summary Web browsers you can use with Canviz


= Introduction =

Canviz requires a web browser that supports the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_(HTML_element) canvas element].


= Browsers =

These browsers are supported:

 * [http://www.apple.com/safari/ Safari] 3.0+ (Safari 2.x has the canvas element but does not support the scale or translate functions which Canviz uses. Safari 3 is a free upgrade from Safari 2.x. Safari 1.x does not have the canvas element and there is no free upgrade.)
 * [http://www.getfirefox.com/ Firefox] 1.5+ (earlier versions don't have the canvas element)
 * [http://www.opera.com/ Opera] 9.0+ (earlier versions don't have the canvas element)
 * [http://www.google.com/chrome Chrome] 1.0+

Other browsers based on current versions of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit WebKit] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(layout_engine) Gecko] layout engines should be compatible as well.

As of version 8, Internet Explorer still does not support the canvas element, but Canviz will support Internet Explorer 6.0 and up through a VML compatibility library. See issue #8.
