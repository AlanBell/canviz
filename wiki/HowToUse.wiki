#summary How to use Canviz

= Introduction =

Canviz began as a proof of conceptâ€”is it possible to draw Graphviz graphs to a browser canvas? I thought a good place to start would be to try to write an example that could render all the sample graphs included with Graphviz. As of October 2008, Canviz can do this. You can see it in action on the [http://www.ryandesign.com/canviz/ demo page]. This wiki page explains how to get this example working on your system.


= Requirements =

The example requires:

 * a web server with PHP support (although Canviz is a !JavaScript library that runs entirely in the browser, the example needs PHP on the server side)
 * a [Browsers supported web browser]
 * Graphviz

The example uses pre-rendered xdot files, so you don't need to install Graphviz on the server; you can install Graphviz on your computer and upload the resulting xdot files to the server.


= Setup =

 * [http://code.google.com/p/canviz/source/checkout Check out] the Canviz trunk.
 * Run `make examples` in the source directory to pre-render the xdot files (besides Graphviz, this requires standard UNIX utilities like make, bash, awk, dirname, find and which, so you need a UNIX-like operating system, or Cygwin on Windows).
 * Upload everything to your server.
 * Access index.html in a web browser.
