#summary To-do list

= Introduction =

Canviz isn't quite at version 1.0 yet, but it's close. Here's what I still want to do before releasing Canviz 1.0.


= Details =

== Internet Explorer for Windows ==

 * <strike>Support IE 6 and 7 (issue #8)</strike>
 * Use Silverlight version of excanvas if possible (issue #43) to fix some issues with the VML version (like issue #41)

== Clickable nodes and edges ==

 * <strike>Support clicking the label of a node or edge (issue #11)</strike>
 * Support clicking the shape of a node or edge (issue #11)
